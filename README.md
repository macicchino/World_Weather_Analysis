## Summary and Thoughts

Being trained as an economist, I found the use of API's to be extremly exciting. The ability to use and access to this data, is valuble for almost all types of research. I plan to be utilizing my newly found API skills for future projects and career ambitions. 

I also noticed reviewing the Google API documentation that they have agricultural data. I plan to use this in my final project and was a great resource to discover.
